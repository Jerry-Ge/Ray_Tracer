   Recursive reflection
   I did the recursive reflection in function "traceRay". In order to use this function: when running the program in command line, add one more argument"-OR" in the end. !!!!!!!!!!!
   E.g: "./assign3 test.scene.txt test.jpg -OR"

   Good antialiasing
   I also have a good antialiasing by using the technqiue of super sampling. 
   You can check from the still images, the boundaries are smooth.

Still Images:
001: from screenfile.txt, no antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
002: from screenfile.txt, with antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
003: from test2.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
004: from test2.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, with recursive reflection
005: from spheres.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
006: from spheres.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, with recursive reflection
007: from table.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
008: from SIGGRAPH.scene.txt, with antialiasing applied, no recursive reflection
